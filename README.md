# ADPentesting101

Welcome to my repository for Active Directory pentesting!

Created with the intention to use it during my final exam in AD pentesting and to have a structured collection of knowledge.

## Structure

This repo is structured in two parts:

- Tools
- Wiki

The Tools section is a collection of various different binaries and scripts that may be useful.

Go to [Tools](https://github.com/maxbirnbacher/ADPentesting101/tree/main/Tools)

The wiki includes guides for almost all stages (the ones I thought I would need) of a typical AD pentest you could encounter during an exam or even in the wild.

Go to [wiki](https://github.com/maxbirnbacher/ADPentesting101/wiki)
