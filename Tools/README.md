A neat little script to check for share access and for subfolder in the given path. Can be used with a wordlist if only a certain list of subfolders are interesting or the access for the main folder is denied.

```
Usage: CheckShareAccess.ps1 -SharePath <SharePath> [-CheckAllSubdirectories] [-WordlistPath <WordlistPath>]

Options:
    -SharePath <SharePath>        Specifies the path to the share to check.
    -CheckAllSubdirectories       Checks all subdirectories of the specified share.
    -WordlistPath <WordlistPath> Specifies a path to a wordlist file for checking known subdirectories.
    -Help                         Displays this help message.

Example:
    .\CheckShareAccess.ps1 -SharePath "\\Server\Share" -CheckAllSubdirectories -WordlistPath "C:\path\to\wordlist.txt"
```
